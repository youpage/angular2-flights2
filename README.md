# Angular 2 and TypeScript Flights

A much better version, that can be easilly extended with other modules... comming here soon

Added CoreJS for Polyfills - it works in IE (almost all features)
Changed the app starting point so we can do refresh
Changed the Package scripts, for build, bundle and start
I used different css technics to display each flight item VS details for each item 

## Running the Application

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)

2. Run `npm install` to install app dependencies

3. Run `npm start` to start the server and launch the app

4. RUn `npm bundle.js --prod` to bundle it in /dist/bundle.min.js
    Modify index.html as per comments to run the bundle
